### Upload the watchface
#### Prerequisites for the android devices
- Glory Fit
- A file manager
#### Steps
- Download watchface(s) with Glory Fit.
- Use the file manager to download the watchfaces /Android/data/com.yc.gloryfit/files in the Main Storage to your pc ( you need to add permissions for the file manager to the gloryfit folder ).
- Edit the watchface with the editor.
- Replace an existing watchface with the edited one.
- Sync the watchface with the Glory Fit application.
- Done.

I have not found other way to upload custom watchface to the MK66.<br />
If someone has a better solution please share it with me and I will publish it.

### Brief compilation instructions:
- The compilation requires cmake and gtkmm3.
- For windows I have used MSys: https://www.msys2.org
- You need to install for both windows and for linux development packages as well.

It took 3 days until the editor was fully functional + an addition day until I found the right checksum routine waht is stored in the file.<br>
I invested around an additional week for refinements and rework until its final usable state.<br>
It took another day to implement the decompression of compressed watchfaces.
